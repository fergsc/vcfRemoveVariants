## take a vcf as input
## randomly remove variants of a specified percent from 1, 2, ... all samples in vcf
## 1 sample has 10% removed, 2 samples have 10% removed, ..., 99 samples have 99% removed, 100 samples have 99% removed.
## Do this numRepeats times.
## written to test imputation accuracy.
## makes use of cvfR library
